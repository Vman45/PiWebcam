# PiWebcam

With PiWebcam you can turn a Raspberry Pi into a fully-featured, dummy-proof Webcam with just one click.

Even if there are already around a number of projects for using a Raspberry Pi as a webcam, they often require advanced knowledge and skills and look like more ad-hoc solutions rather than finite, reusable products.

PiWebcam is intended to provide a powerful imaging platform for everyone, regardless of his/her previous knowledge.

PiWebcam ships as an ready-to-be-flashed SD card image. Alternatively, an installation script takes care of fully configuring a vanilla Raspbian with the required software and reasonable default settings.

Thanks to its powerful motion detection feature, augmented by an object recognition capabilities, PiWebcam can notify the user by sending the motion picture to an e-mail recipient or a Slack channel.
